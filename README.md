   - Create a new project
   - Get your project URL and anon key from the project settings

2. Create the tasks table in Supabase:

   create table tasks (
     id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
     title text not null,
     scheduled_date date,
     scheduled_time time,
     completed boolean default false,
     created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
   );
   ```
